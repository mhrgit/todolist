# todolist
Simple test project implemented using EF Code First with migrations, Web Api, unit tests with Moq and NUnit, dependency injection with
Ninject, Angular, and javascript unit tests with Jasmine.  

Please run update-database command in package manager console and choose Api and Web project as startup projects so that Web Api project
can serve to requests made from Web client. 

This is the first working version of the project and new features and refactoring will be applied soon.
